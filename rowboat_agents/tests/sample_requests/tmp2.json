Could you start by briefly walking us through your leadership journey over the past decade?\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:01] User: Absolutely. Over the past 12 years, I've led product and technology teams across high-growth B2B SaaS companies. Most recently, I was the Chief Product Officer at a fintech scaleup, where I built a team of 60+ PMs and oversaw the expansion into three international markets. Prior to that, I was VP of Product at a healthtech startup acquired by a public company.\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:03] Assistant: Impressive. What would you say is your core leadership style, and how has it evolved over the years?\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:04] User: I'd describe my style as mission-oriented and data-driven. Early in my career, I leaned heavily on execution. But with time, I've grown more focused on setting context and empowering teams. At my last company, I implemented OKRs org-wide and focused on building a culture of trust and transparency.\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:06] Assistant: How do you approach scaling an org while preserving agility and innovation?\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:07] User: Great question. I believe the key is in modular team design. At the fintech company, we adopted a \"startup within a startup\" model‚Äîeach pod owned metrics and had embedded PMs, designers, and engineers. This preserved autonomy and speed while scaling. We also invested heavily in internal tooling and rituals like demo days to keep the culture of innovation alive.\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:10] Assistant: Tell me about a time you made a high-stakes decision without perfect data.\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:11] User: In early 2023, we had to decide whether to sunset a low-performing but vocal customer-facing feature. We lacked conclusive cohort data but saw consistent qualitative feedback about confusion and churn. I convened a task force, aligned with customer success and execs, and made the call. Within 60 days, churn dropped by 12%, validating the bet.\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:14] Assistant: Final question‚Äîwhat excites you about potentially joining our company as a Chief Product Officer?\n\n[2025-05-02, 10:15] User: Your mission aligns with what I care about‚Äîbringing transparency and efficiency to financial infrastructure. The team's reputation, your engineering culture, and the velocity of product innovation are all huge draws. I believe I can help you scale without losing the edge that got you here.",
