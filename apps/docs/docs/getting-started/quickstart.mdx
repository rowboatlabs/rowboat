# Cloud Setup

Using the open-source version of Rowboat requires more technical skill to set up and navigate. For the smoothest experience, we recommend using our [hosted version](https://dev.rowboatlabs.com/)

---

# Local Setup

<Note>Pre-requisite: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. You'll also need an OpenAI account and API key to use the Copilot and agents.</Note>


<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your OpenAI key">
    Export your OpenAI API key in your terminal:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the repository and start Rowboat Docker">
    Clone the Rowboat repository and start the app using Docker:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:rowboatlabs/rowboat.git
    cd rowboat
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the app">
    Once Docker is running, open your browser and go to:

    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  </Step>
</Steps>


<Info>See the [Using custom LLM providers](#using-custom-llm-providers) section below for using custom providers like OpenRouter and LiteLLM. </Info>

## Using custom LLM providers
By default, Rowboat uses OpenAI LLMs (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, etc.) for both agents and copilot, when you export your OPENAI_API_KEY. 

However, you can also configure custom LLM providers (e.g. LiteLLM, OpenRouter) to use any of the hundreds of available LLMs beyond OpenAI, such as Claude, DeepSeek, Ollama LLMs and so on.
