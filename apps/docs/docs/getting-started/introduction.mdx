## What is RowBoat?
**RowBoat is a state-of-art platform to build multi-agent AI systems in a visual interface, with the help of a copilot.**

RowBoat enables you to build, manage and deploy user-facing assistants. An assistant is made up of multiple agents, each having access to a set of tools and working together to interact with the user as a single assistant. You can connect any MCP tools to the agents.

For example, you can build a *credit card assistant*, where each agent handles a workflow such as *outstanding payments*, *balance inquiries* and *transaction disputes*. You can equip agents with tools to carry out tasks such as *fetching payment options*, *checking outstanding balance* and *updating user information*. The assistant would help your end-users their credit card-related needs without having to talk to a human agent on your end.

## How RowBoat works

### RowBoat Studio
RowBoat Studio lets you create AI agents in minutes, using a visual interface and plain language. 
There are key components that you will work with:
- Agents
- Playground
- Copilot

### RowBoat Chat API & SDK
- [RowBoat Chat API](/docs/api-sdk/using_the_api) is a stateless HTTP API to interface with the assistant created on RowBoat Studio. You can use the API to drive end-user facing conversations in your app or website.
- [RowBoat Chat SDK](/docs/api-sdk/using_the_sdk) is a simple SDK (currently available in Python) which wraps the HTTP API under the hood. It offers both stateful and stateless (OpenAI-style) implementations.
