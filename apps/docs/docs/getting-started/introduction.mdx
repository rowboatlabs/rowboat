## What is RowBoat?
**RowBoat is a state-of-art platform to build multi-agent AI systems in a visual interface, with the help of a copilot.**

RowBoat enables you to build, manage and deploy user-facing assistants. An assistant is made up of multiple agents, each having access to a set of tools and working together to interact with the user as a single assistant. You can connect any tool to the agents.

For example, you can build a *meeting prep assistant* that helps you prepare for upcoming meetings. One agent can access your Google Calendar to see your scheduled meetings, another agent can research the meeting attendees (such as finding their LinkedIn profiles or recent news), and a third agent can compile this research and send it to your email before the meeting. This way, you get automated, personalized meeting prep without manual effort.

### RowBoat Chat API & SDK
- [RowBoat Chat API](/docs/api-sdk/using_the_api) is a stateless HTTP API to interface with the assistant created on RowBoat Studio. You can use the API to drive end-user facing conversations in your app or website.
- [RowBoat Chat SDK](/docs/api-sdk/using_the_sdk) is a simple Python SDK which wraps the HTTP API under the hood. It provides a clean interface for managing conversations using conversation IDs for state management.
