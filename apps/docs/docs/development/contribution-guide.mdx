## Ways to Contribute

**Report bugs or suggest improvements** — If something feels off or could be better, [open an issue](https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat/issues/new). Include steps to reproduce for bugs, or a clear description of the improvement you have in mind.

**Fix an existing issue** — Browse [open issues](https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat/issues) and comment on one to let us know you're working on it.

**Propose a new feature or integration** — Open an issue first so we can discuss the approach before you invest time building it.

**Improve documentation** — Typos, unclear explanations, missing examples — all fair game.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** [rowboatlabs/rowboat](https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat) and clone it locally.
2. **Create a branch from `dev`** with a descriptive name (`fix-tool-crash`, `feature-mcp-discovery`).
3. **Make your changes.** Keep PRs focused on a single issue or feature.
4. **Test your changes** locally before submitting.
5. **Open a pull request against `dev`** (not `main`) with a clear description of what you changed and why. Screenshots or short demos are appreciated for UI changes.
6. **Respond to feedback** — maintainers may request changes. This is normal and collaborative.
7. **Merge!** Once approved, we'll merge your PR.

<Tip>For small fixes like typos or formatting, try bundling related changes into a single PR rather than submitting them individually.</Tip>

## Guidelines

- **One PR, one concern.** Don't mix unrelated changes in the same pull request.
- **Write clear commit messages.** A reviewer should understand what changed from the message alone.
- **Follow existing code style.** Match the patterns you see in the codebase.
- **Be patient and respectful.** We review PRs as quickly as we can. A polite ping on Discord is always welcome if things go quiet.
