# Tools
- Tools are used to carry out specific tasks such as fetching or updating information.
- Tools can be defined once in RowBoat Studio and reused across different agents.
- RowBoat uses OpenAI style tools with name, description and parameters.
- For the purposes of quick testing in the Playground, RowBoat Studio can mock tool responses based on tool descriptions.
- Developers can easily connect tools to APIs by configuring MCP servers or Webhook URL in Settings.
