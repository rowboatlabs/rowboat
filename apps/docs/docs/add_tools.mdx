## Add tools to agents
Copilot can help you add tools to agents. You can (a) add a mock tool, (b) add a tool from an MCP server, (c) integrate with you own tools using a webhook.


### Adding mock tools
You can mock any tool you have created by checking the 'Mock tool responses' option.

### Adding MCP tools

You can add a running MCP server in Settings -> Tools.

You can use [supergateway](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway) to expose any MCP stdio server as an SSE server.

Now, you can import the tools from the MCP server in the Build view.

### Debug tool calls in the playground
When agents call tools during a chat in the playground, the tool call parameters and response are available for debugging real-time. For testing purposes, the platform can produce mock tool responses in the playground, without integrating actual tools.
