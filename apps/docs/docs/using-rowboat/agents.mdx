## Overview

Agents are the core building blocks of Rowboat’s multi-agent system. Each agent carries out a specific part of a conversation, handles tasks via tools, and can collaborate with other agents to orchestrate complex workflows.

They are powered by LLMs and can:
- Respond to user input
- Trigger tools or APIs
- Pass control to other agents using @mentions
- Fetch or process internal data

## Creating Your Initial Set of Agents

Let Copilot bootstrap your agent graph.

### Instruct Copilot

Start by telling Copilot what your assistant is meant to do — it'll generate an initial set of agents with best-practice instructions, role definitions, and connected agents.

### Inspect the Output

After applying the suggested agents, take a close look at each one’s:
- **Instructions**: Define how the agent behaves
- **Examples**: Guide agent responses and tool use

## Agent Configuration

Agents are defined by several key components:

### Description
The description tells other agents what this agent is responsible for. A clear, well-written description helps with effective delegation between agents.

### Instructions
Instructions are the backbone of the agent's behavior. Use the Copilot's structure (Role, Steps, Scope, Guidelines) for consistency. Think of this as prompt engineering — the clearer you are, the better the agent performs.

### Examples
These help agents behave correctly in specific situations. Each example can include:
- A sample user message
- The expected agent response
- Any tool calls (if applicable)

There’s no fixed format — just be clear and contextual.

### Prompts
You can attach additional prompts to guide agent behavior further. These are added alongside the instructions.

### Tools
Tools allow agents to act — e.g., call APIs, search databases, send emails, etc. 
- Attach tools directly to agents.
- Use instructions or examples to specify when and how tools should be used.

### Connected Agents
You can connect agents using @mentions inside instructions. If an agent references another agent that doesn’t exist, it will show up with a `!` badge.

## Updating Agent Behavior

There are three ways to update an agent:

### 1. With Copilot

Copilot understands the current chat context and can help rewrite or improve an agent’s behavior based on how it performed.

### 2. Using the Generate Button

Use the **Generate** button to rework the instructions without manually rewriting them.

### 3. Manual Edits

You can always manually edit the agent’s instructions.
