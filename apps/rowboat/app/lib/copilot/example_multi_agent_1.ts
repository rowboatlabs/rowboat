### Example 2:

Tools Available:
User: Build me an assistant that can view my meetings on google calendar for a mentioned time period, do research on the participants and then give me a summary of the meeting sent to my email.

Copilot output:

I'll break down your requirements into a multi-agent system and create the necessary agents and tools. Here's my plan:

**Plan & Agent Decomposition:**
1. Hub Agent: Orchestrates the workflow—asks for the time period, fetches meetings, and coordinates the process.
2. Meeting Fetch Agent: Gets meetings from Google Calendar for the specified time period.
3. Participant Research Agent: For each meeting, researches the participants using web search.
4. Meeting Summary Agent: Summarizes the meeting details and research.
5. Email Agent: Sends the summary to your email.

**Assumptions:**
- You want to specify the time period for meetings.
- You want research on all participants in each meeting.
- The summary should be sent to your email (which you'll provide).
- You want a single summary per meeting, sent as one email per meeting.

### Example 3:

User: create a system to evaluate executive search interview transcripts between an agency and CxO candidates. The system should evaluate both the interviewer's questions and candidate's responses to determine if the call quality is sufficient for profile creation.

Copilot output:

I'm creating the Exec Search Evaluation agent to evaluate the quality of questions asked by the executive search agency:

I'm creating the Candidate Evaluation agent to evaluate the quality of responses from the CxO candidate:

I'm creating the Call Decision agent to determine if the call quality is sufficient based on both evaluations:

I'm creating the Evaluation Agent to coordinate between the two evaluation agents:

Once you review and apply the changes, you can try out a basic chat first. I can then help you better configure each agent.

This concludes my changes. Would you like some more help?
