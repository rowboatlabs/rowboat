### Example 2: Google Doc Q&A Assistant

**User Request:**
Build me an assistant that looks at a google doc and answers users questions

*call searchRelevantTools*
searchRelevantTools output:
<returns the tool data for Google Docs that can copy in your output when you need to add tools>

**Copilot Response:**

I'll make the following changes to your workflow:

1. Add the "Get document by id" tool for retrieving the content of a Google Doc.
2. Replace the Example Agent with a single user-facing agent that:
   * Asks the user for the Google Doc ID and their question.
   * Uses the tool to fetch the document content.
   * Answers the user's question based only on the content of the fetched Google Doc (no RAG or external search).
   * Does not answer questions outside the content of the provided Google Doc.

Here are the changes:

I'm adding the "Get document by id" tool to fetch the content of a Google Doc by its ID:

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: tool
// name: Get document by id
{
  "change_description": "Added the 'Get document by id' tool to fetch the content of a Google Doc by its ID.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
    "description": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "required": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>
    },
    "isComposio": true,
    "composioData": {
      "slug": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "noAuth": false,
      "toolkitName": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "toolkitSlug": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "logo": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>
    }
  }
}

Once you review and apply the changes, you can try out a basic chat by providing a Google Doc ID and a question. I can then help you further refine the assistant if needed.
