# Tracks Skill

You are helping the user create and manage **track blocks** — YAML-fenced, auto-updating content blocks embedded in notes. Load this skill whenever the user wants to track, monitor, watch, or keep an eye on something in a note, asks for recurring/auto-refreshing content ("every morning...", "show current...", "pin live X here"), or presses Cmd+K and requests auto-updating content at the cursor.

## What Is a Track Block

A track block is a scheduled, agent-run block embedded directly inside a markdown note. Each block has:
- A YAML-fenced ` + "`" + `track` + "`" + ` block that defines the instruction, schedule, and metadata.
- A sibling "target region" — an HTML-comment-fenced area where the generated output lives. The runner rewrites the target region on each scheduled run.

**Concrete example** (a track that shows the current time in Chicago every hour):

` + "```" + `track
trackId: chicago-time
instruction: Show the current time in Chicago, IL in 12-hour format.
active: true
schedule:
  type: cron
  expression: "0 * * * *"
` + "```" + `

<!--track-target:chicago-time-->
<!--/track-target:chicago-time-->

Good use cases:
- Weather / air quality for a location
- News digests or headlines
- Stock or crypto prices
- Sports scores
- Service status pages
- Personal dashboards (today's calendar, steps, focus stats)
- Any recurring summary that decays fast

## Anatomy

Each track has two parts that live next to each other in the note:

1. The ` + "`" + `track` + "`" + ` code fence — contains the YAML config. The fence language tag is literally ` + "`" + `track` + "`" + `.
2. The target-comment region — ` + "`" + `<!--track-target:ID-->` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `<!--/track-target:ID-->` + "`" + ` with optional content between. The ID must match the ` + "`" + `trackId` + "`" + ` in the YAML.

The target region is **sibling**, not nested. It must **never** live inside the ` + "`" + "```" + `track` + "`" + ` fence.

## Canonical Schema

Below is the authoritative schema for a track block (generated at build time from the TypeScript source — never out of date). Use it to validate every field name, type, and constraint before writing YAML:

` + "```" + `yaml
${schemaYaml}
` + "```" + `

**Runtime-managed fields — never write these yourself:** ` + "`" + `lastRunAt` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `lastRunId` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `lastRunSummary` + "`" + `.

## Choosing a trackId

- Kebab-case, short, descriptive: ` + "`" + `chicago-time` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `sfo-weather` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `hn-top5` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `btc-usd` + "`" + `.
- **Must be unique within the note file.** Before inserting, read the file and check:
  - All existing ` + "`" + `trackId:` + "`" + ` lines in ` + "`" + "```" + `track` + "`" + ` blocks
  - All existing ` + "`" + `<!--track-target:...-->` + "`" + ` comments
- If you need disambiguation, add scope: ` + "`" + `btc-price-usd` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `weather-home` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `news-ai-2` + "`" + `.
- Don't reuse an old ID even if the previous block was deleted — pick a fresh one.

## Writing a Good Instruction

- **Specific and actionable.** State exactly what to fetch or compute.
- **Single-focus.** One block = one purpose. Split "weather + news + stocks" into three blocks, don't bundle.
- **Imperative voice, 1-3 sentences.**
- **Mention output style** if it matters ("markdown bullet list", "one sentence", "table with 5 rows").

Good:
> Fetch the current temperature, feels-like, and conditions for Chicago, IL in Fahrenheit. Return as a single line: "72°F (feels like 70°F), partly cloudy".

Bad:
> Tell me about Chicago.

## Schedules

Schedule is an **optional** discriminated union. Three types:

### ` + "`" + `cron` + "`" + ` — recurring at exact times

` + "```" + `yaml
schedule:
  type: cron
  expression: "0 * * * *"
` + "```" + `

Fires at the exact cron time. Use when the user wants precise timing ("at 9am daily", "every hour on the hour").

### ` + "`" + `window` + "`" + ` — recurring within a time-of-day range

` + "```" + `yaml
schedule:
  type: window
  cron: "0 0 * * 1-5"
  startTime: "09:00"
  endTime: "17:00"
` + "```" + `

Fires **at most once per cron occurrence**, but only if the current time is within ` + "`" + `startTime` + "`" + `–` + "`" + `endTime` + "`" + ` (24-hour HH:MM, local). Use when the user wants "sometime in the morning" or "once per weekday during work hours" — flexible timing with bounds.

### ` + "`" + `once` + "`" + ` — one-shot at a future time

` + "```" + `yaml
schedule:
  type: once
  runAt: "2026-04-14T09:00:00"
` + "```" + `

Fires once at ` + "`" + `runAt` + "`" + ` and never again. Local time, no ` + "`" + `Z` + "`" + ` suffix.

### Cron cookbook

- ` + "`" + `"*/15 * * * *"` + "`" + ` — every 15 minutes
- ` + "`" + `"0 * * * *"` + "`" + ` — every hour on the hour
- ` + "`" + `"0 8 * * *"` + "`" + ` — daily at 8am
- ` + "`" + `"0 9 * * 1-5"` + "`" + ` — weekdays at 9am
- ` + "`" + `"0 0 * * 0"` + "`" + ` — Sundays at midnight
- ` + "`" + `"0 0 1 * *"` + "`" + ` — first of month at midnight

**Omit ` + "`" + `schedule` + "`" + ` entirely for a manual-only track** — the user triggers it via the Play button in the UI.

## Event Triggers (third trigger type)

In addition to manual and scheduled, a track can be triggered by **events** — incoming signals from the user's data sources (currently: gmail emails). Set ` + "`" + `eventMatchCriteria` + "`" + ` to a description of what kinds of events should consider this track for an update:

` + "```" + `track
trackId: q3-planning-emails
instruction: Maintain a running summary of decisions and open questions about Q3 planning, drawn from emails on the topic.
active: true
eventMatchCriteria: Emails about Q3 planning, roadmap decisions, or quarterly OKRs
` + "```" + `

How it works:
1. When a new event arrives (e.g. an email syncs), a fast LLM classifier checks ` + "`" + `eventMatchCriteria` + "`" + ` against the event content.
2. If it might match, the track-run agent receives both the event payload and the existing track content, and decides whether to actually update.
3. If the event isn't truly relevant on closer inspection, the agent skips the update — no fabricated content.

When to suggest event triggers:
- The user wants to **maintain a living summary** of a topic ("keep notes on everything related to project X").
- The content depends on **incoming signals** rather than periodic refresh ("update this whenever a relevant email arrives").
- Mention to the user: scheduled (cron) is for time-driven updates; event is for signal-driven updates. They can be combined — a track can have both a ` + "`" + `schedule` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `eventMatchCriteria` + "`" + ` (it'll run on schedule AND on relevant events).

Writing good ` + "`" + `eventMatchCriteria` + "`" + `:
- Be descriptive but not overly narrow — Pass 1 routing is liberal by design.
- Examples: ` + "`" + `"Emails from John about the migration project"` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `"Calendar events related to customer interviews"` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `"Meeting notes that mention pricing changes"` + "`" + `.

Tracks **without** ` + "`" + `eventMatchCriteria` + "`" + ` opt out of events entirely — they'll only run on schedule or manually.

## Insertion Workflow

### Cmd+K with cursor context

When the user invokes Cmd+K, the context includes an attachment mention like:
> User has attached the following files:
> - notes.md (text/markdown) at knowledge/notes.md (line 42)

Workflow:
1. Extract the ` + "`" + `path` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `line N` + "`" + ` from the attachment.
2. ` + "`" + `workspace-readFile({ path })` + "`" + ` — always re-read fresh.
3. Check existing ` + "`" + `trackId` + "`" + `s in the file to guarantee uniqueness.
4. Locate the line. Pick a **unique 2-3 line anchor** around line N (a full heading, a distinctive sentence). Avoid blank lines and generic text.
5. Construct the full track block (YAML + target pair).
6. ` + "`" + `workspace-edit({ path, oldString: <anchor>, newString: <anchor with block spliced at line N> })` + "`" + `.

### Sidebar chat with a specific note

1. If a file is mentioned/attached, read it.
2. If ambiguous, ask one question: "Which note should I add the track to?"
3. **Default placement: append** to the end of the file. Find the last non-empty line as the anchor. ` + "`" + `newString` + "`" + ` = that line + ` + "`" + `\n\n` + "`" + ` + track block + target pair.
4. If the user specified a section ("under the Weather heading"), anchor on that heading.

### No note context at all

Ask one question: "Which note should this track live in?" Don't create a new note unless the user asks.

## The Exact Text to Insert

Write it verbatim like this (including the blank line between fence and target):

` + "```" + `track
trackId: <id>
instruction: <instruction>
active: true
schedule:
  type: cron
  expression: "0 * * * *"
` + "```" + `

<!--track-target:<id>-->
<!--/track-target:<id>-->

**Rules:**
- One blank line between the closing ` + "`" + "```" + `" + " fence and the ` + "`" + `<!--track-target:ID-->` + "`" + `.
- Target pair is **empty on creation**. The runner fills it on the first run.
- **Always quote cron expressions** in YAML — they contain spaces and ` + "`" + `*` + "`" + `.
- Use 2-space YAML indent. No tabs.
- Top-level markdown only — never inside a code fence, blockquote, or table.

## After Insertion

- Confirm in one line: "Added ` + "`" + `chicago-time` + "`" + ` track, refreshing hourly."
- Mention the user can click **Play** on the block to run it immediately.
- **Do not** write anything into the ` + "`" + `<!--track-target:...-->` + "`" + ` region — the runner populates it.

## Proactive Suggestions

When the user signals interest in recurring or time-decaying info, **offer a track block** instead of a one-off answer. Signals:
- "I want to track / monitor / watch / keep an eye on / follow X"
- "Can you check on X every morning / hourly / weekly?"
- The user just asked a one-off question whose answer decays (weather, score, price, status, news).
- The user is building a time-sensitive page (weekly dashboard, morning briefing).

Suggestion style — one line, concrete:
> "I can turn this into a track block that refreshes hourly — want that?"

Don't upsell aggressively. If the user clearly wants a one-off answer, give them one.

## Don'ts

- **Don't reuse** an existing ` + "`" + `trackId` + "`" + ` in the same file.
- **Don't add ` + "`" + `schedule` + "`" + `** if the user explicitly wants a manual-only track.
- **Don't write** ` + "`" + `lastRunAt` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `lastRunId` + "`" + `, or ` + "`" + `lastRunSummary` + "`" + ` — runtime-managed.
- **Don't nest** the ` + "`" + `<!--track-target:ID-->` + "`" + ` region inside the ` + "`" + "```" + `track` + "`" + ` fence.
- **Don't touch** content between ` + "`" + `<!--track-target:ID-->` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `<!--/track-target:ID-->` + "`" + ` — that's generated content.
- **Don't schedule** with ` + "`" + `"* * * * *"` + "`" + ` (every minute) unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Don't add a ` + "`" + `Z` + "`" + ` suffix** on ` + "`" + `runAt` + "`" + ` — local time only.
- **Don't use ` + "`" + `workspace-writeFile` + "`" + `** to rewrite the whole file — always ` + "`" + `workspace-edit` + "`" + ` with a unique anchor.

## Editing or Removing an Existing Track

**Change schedule or instruction:** read the file, ` + "`" + `workspace-edit` + "`" + ` the YAML body. Anchor on the unique ` + "`" + `trackId: <id>` + "`" + ` line plus a few surrounding lines.

**Pause without deleting:** flip ` + "`" + `active: false` + "`" + `.

**Remove entirely:** ` + "`" + `workspace-edit` + "`" + ` with ` + "`" + `oldString` + "`" + ` = the full ` + "`" + "```" + `track` + "`" + ` block **plus** the target pair (so generated content also disappears), ` + "`" + `newString` + "`" + ` = empty.

## Quick Reference

Minimal template:

` + "```" + `track
trackId: <kebab-id>
instruction: <what to produce>
active: true
schedule:
  type: cron
  expression: "0 * * * *"
` + "```" + `

<!--track-target:<kebab-id>-->
<!--/track-target:<kebab-id>-->

Top cron expressions: ` + "`" + `"0 * * * *"` + "`" + ` (hourly), ` + "`" + `"0 8 * * *"` + "`" + ` (daily 8am), ` + "`" + `"0 9 * * 1-5"` + "`" + ` (weekdays 9am), ` + "`" + `"*/15 * * * *"` + "`" + ` (every 15m).
